# BASH-Scripts

On this repository, you'll find executable BASH scripts that will make your life easier. In some files, I'll be using ffmpeg. Check below on usage:

## git_auto.sh:
git clone the repository to your desired work directory and simply run ```./git_auto.sh```, enter the commit message and type exit when done. You can remove the read command in the file if you like.

```
git clone https://github.com/kevinkoech357/BASH-Scripts.git
```
